## Bugs? 
I'm sure there's a lot of these! Please report them to Sourfruit by either (a) tweeting @s0urfruit, (b) emailing me at hello@def-not-hacking-the.net, or (c) opening an issue here.

## Why Takeout.web if that's not the site's domain?
It goes with Takeout.js, Takeout.py, etc. 

## Hosting it yourself
Well, I wish you luck! If you scroll through the code, you'll see Takeout trying to call seemingly non-existent directories. And, well, they don't exist in this repository, as they have been removed. To be transparent, this is missing /api/, templates/, public/ and lib/. These may become public later.

## If so much is missing, why publish it?
Because why not, and I can steal code from it later! It also allows me to show a more public version of actual development logs.
